The values are sent to Realex Payments via hidden fields in a HTML form POST.
Please look at the documentation to show all the possible hidden fields you
can send to Realex Payments.

Note:> 
The more data you send to Realex Payments the more details will be available
on our reporting tool, realControl, for the merchant to view and pull reports 
down from.

will be POSTed back directly to your response script. This way you can maintain
data even when you are redirected away from your site
